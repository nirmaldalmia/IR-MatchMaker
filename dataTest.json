In her own words: I love music of all kinds! My tryst with the violin has led me to discover some great pieces in both Hindustani classical as well as Western classical (which I am currently trying to perfect). Once a song catches my fancy, it just does. So I have no particular genre preference, but my favorites include Oh Wonder, Lorde, Halsey, Coldplay (who doesn't?), One Republic, Of Monsters and Men and many more.
