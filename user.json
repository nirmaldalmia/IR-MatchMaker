You are authority-challenging: you prefer to challenge authority and traditional values to help bring about positive changes. And you are hedonistic: you feel your desires strongly and are easily tempted by them.\nYour choices are driven by a desire for discovery.\nYou are relatively unconcerned with tradition: you care more about making your own path than following what others have done. You value helping others a bit more: you think it is important to take care of the people around you.",
